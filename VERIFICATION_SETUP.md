   - You should see your verification codes

2. **Verify in Search Console:**

   - Click "Verify"
   - Wait a few seconds for verification to complete

## Troubleshooting

### Verification Fails

1. **Check the meta tag is visible:**
   - Make sure the site is deployed (not just running locally)

2. **Check for typos:**
   - Verify the code matches exactly (no extra spaces)

4. **Check your site is accessible:**

   - No authentication required for the homepage
   - No robots.txt blocking Google/Bing bots
